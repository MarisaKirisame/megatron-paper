\begin{abstract}
Latency is a major concern for web rendering engines
  like those in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
These engines reduce latency by using
  an \emph{incremental layout algorithm}
  to redraw the page when
  the user interacts with it.
In such an algorithm,
  nodes that change frame-to-frame are marked dirty;
  only the dirty nodes need be processed
  to draw the next frame,
  dramatically reducing latency.
However, the standard incremental layout algorithm
  must search the tree for dirty nodes,
  accessing a number of auxiliary nodes
  in the process.
These auxiliary nodes
  add cache misses and stalled cycles,
  and are responsible for a sizable fraction
  of all layout latency.

We introduce a new, faster incremental layout algorithm
  called Spineless Traversal.
Spineless Traversal
  uses a more computationally demanding
  priority queue algorithm
  to avoid the need to access auxiliary nodes
  and thus reduces cache traffic and stalls.
This leads to dramatic speedups
  on the most latency-critical interactions
  such as hovering, typing, or animations.
Moreover, thanks to numerous low-level optimizations,
  we are able to make Spineless Traversal
  competitive across the whole spectrum of
  incremental layout workloads.
As a result, across on \NumFrames~benchmarks,
  Spineless Traversal is faster on \PctFaster,
  with a mean speedup of \MeanSpeedup,
  with the speedups concentrated in
  the most latency-critical interactions
  such as hovering, typing, or animations.

\section{Related Work}
Incremental Evaluation of interactive programs have yield a long line of fruitful research, dating back to the 1980s (\citet{TR}), and including work such as \cite{yufeng-2}, \cite{SAC}. OTOH, the industry had developed their own solution, the Double Dirty Bit algorithm, to fulfill their latency need.
